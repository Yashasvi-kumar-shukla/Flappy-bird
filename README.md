# Flappy Bird Game 🐦🎮

A fun, engaging clone of the classic Flappy Bird game! This project was built using a prebuilt skeleton, which I debugged and enhanced with exciting new features and improved visuals.

## Features 🚀
- **Classic Flappy Bird Gameplay:** Navigate through obstacles and achieve high scores!
- **Improved Graphics:** New and vibrant backgrounds for a fresh look.
- **Ceiling Trap Mechanic:** A challenging trap slows the bird’s descent initially but makes it fall suddenly with increased speed.
- **Scoreboard:** A dynamic and functional scoreboard to track your achievements.

## Debugging and Enhancements 🛠️
During development, the prebuilt skeleton had several issues which were resolved:
1. **Logic Error on Chrome:** The game initially failed to run on Google Chrome due to a logic bug. Fixed this issue to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
2. **Missing Assets:** Reintegrated missing assets, including graphics and sound files, to bring the game to life.
3. **Scoreboard Issue:** Addressed a rendering bug in the scoreboard, ensuring it updates correctly during gameplay.
